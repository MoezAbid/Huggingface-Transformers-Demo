Loss functions are used in regression when finding a line of best fit by minimizing the overall loss of all the points with the prediction from the line. Loss functions are used while training perceptrons and neural networks by influencing how their weights are updated.  The larger the loss is, the larger the update.  By minimizing the loss, the model‚Äôs accuracy is maximized. However, the tradeoff between size of update and minimal loss must be evaluated in these machine learning applications."
